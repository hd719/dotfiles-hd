### 🔍 Breakdown of `> /dev/null 2>&1 &`

This shell syntax is often used to **run commands in the background** while suppressing all output (both stdout and stderr). Here's what each part means:

| Part              | Meaning                                 | Explanation                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `>`               | Redirect stdout                          | Redirects **standard output (stdout)** — file descriptor `1`.               |
| `/dev/null`       | Null device                              | A special file that discards all data written to it. Like a black hole.     |
| `2>&1`            | Redirect stderr to stdout                | Redirects **standard error (stderr)** — file descriptor `2` — to wherever stdout is going (which is `/dev/null`). |
| `&`               | Run in background                        | Tells the shell to **run the command in the background**.                   |
